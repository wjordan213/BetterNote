TODO:


First:
  refactor everything in one foul swoop

Refactoring TODO:
  - dry up api
  - extract more functionality into pane-changer mixin
  - take out BetterNote.sidePane

then
  -tag addition/destruction on note form
    -textbox's render/destroy based on activated status of container
    -buttons with tag names render/destroy based on user creating/deleting
    tags.
    -QUESTION:
      -should I make ajax calls right away or start out with standard whole
      form submission?




Future:
-notebook edit/show combination
  -use drop down as a convenient way to show notebook

- notes api:
  -refactor h2 on sidepane to only rerender that part on

- error messages on top of primary view for when things go wrong. get teacher's help
  -error message for invalid form input
  -error message for after redirect when trying to go to note submission without already having a notebook

- note form looking awesome might complicate the api. beware

- update timeline

CSS:
  -style sidebar buttons
  -pick appropriate colors


Concerns:
  -success callback not being called upon successful model destruction.
