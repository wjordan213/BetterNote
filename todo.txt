TODO:

Currently Working On:
  -note composite view conversion
  -see note_form_plan.txt

Future:
-notebook edit/show combination
  -use drop down as a convenient way to show notebook

- notes api:
  -refactor h2 on sidepane to only rerender that part on

- error messages on top of primary view for when things go wrong. get teacher's help
  -error message for invalid form input
  -error message for after redirect when trying to go to note submission without already having a notebook

- note form looking awesome might complicate the api. beware

- update timeline

CSS:
  -style sidebar buttons
  -pick appropriate colors


Concerns:
  -this._tags = new BetterNote.Collections.Tags([], { note: this });
    -why exactly? are the arguments included like this?
  -success callback not being called upon successful model destruction.
