Current Issue:



issues:

  -layout is unrendered under dev tools which looks weird

  -

  -looks like the javascripts are being loaded on sign up and sign in page. this needs to be fixed

  -check to see if no notebooks have been created yet, if so, redirect to notebook creation page





1)errors for note form:
  <% if (!(typeof errors === undefined)) { %>
    <ul>
      <% errors.forEach(function(error) { %>
        <li><%= error %></li>
      <% }) %>
    </ul>
  <% } %>
was throwing error.
