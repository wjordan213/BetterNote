TODO:

-prevent note creation without notebook
  -preferrably redirect user to notebook form, have them fill that out, then on creation the note automatically goes in the form.
  -set event listeners on global collections
-make note#notebook function
-check to see if the note is the notebook in each dropdown item


problem:
  - when clicking on link to make a new note in a current notebook,
    persist that notebook's id and set it to the default in the dropdown
    for the note form. right now the type is wrong. maybe I should consider having a model type. look into situations where the side pane has a model.

    -learn the inner workings of all of this backwards and forwards before moving forward but AFTER the new note form has been created.



- make note edit/create page

- have edit form display title for notebooks

- Move on to tags


Question:
  -success callback not being called upon successful model destruction.
  -ask why collection is the same as it was on last instantiation for notes index
  -Is my approach to the root html with  wrong?

notes api:
-refactor h2 on sidepane to only rerender that part on




Future:

- note form looking awesome might complicate the api. beware

- after day is over
  - update timeline
  - update wireframes with project notes

CSS:
  -style sidebar buttons
  -pick appropriate colors
