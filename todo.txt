TODO:

- TAGS:
  -db: note_id, title,
  -api: create, destroy, index, show

  order to proceed in:
  -model/migration
  -routes
  -controller

Question:
  -success callback not being called upon successful model destruction.
  -ask why collection is the same as it was on last instantiation for notes index
  -Is my approach to the root html with  wrong?

Future:

- notes api:
  -refactor h2 on sidepane to only rerender that part on
- error messages on top of primary view for when things go wrong. get teacher's help
  -error message for invalid form input
  -error message for after redirect when trying to go to note submission without already having a notebook

- note form looking awesome might complicate the api. beware

- update timeline

CSS:
  -style sidebar buttons
  -pick appropriate colors
