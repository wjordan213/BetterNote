Future:

-remove tags after all their taggings are gone

-remove new note from tag show side pane

-fix bugs with random errors popping up due to bad stack order at startup
-get it so that new can switch to edit on a note seamlessly, thus eliminating the need for the form header
  -means setting off click event after navigating to edit page

-notebook edit/show combination
  -use drop down as a convenient way to show notebook

- notes api:
  -refactor h2 on sidepane to only rerender that part on

- error messages on top of primary view for when things go wrong. get teacher's help
  -error message for invalid form input
  -error message for after redirect when trying to go to note submission without already having a notebook

CSS:
  -style sidebar buttons
  -pick appropriate colors


Concerns:
  -this._tags = new BetterNote.Collections.Tags([], { note: this });
    -why exactly? are the arguments included like this?
  -success callback not being called upon successful model destruction.
