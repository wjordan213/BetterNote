TODO:

ORDER:
  -styles(weekend)
  -omni-auth
    -share to fb
  -search
  -styles/design changes
  -drag and drop
  -file upload
    -pdf


Features:
  -file upload
  -search
  -omni-auth w/ google
  -share to gmail
  -drag and drop

Bugs:
  -image upload not working in production.
    -ArgumentError (missing required :bucket option)


Styles/jquery style changes:
  -pixel perfect to evernote: color, sizes, sprites
  -custom styles for notes/notebooks/tags
  -fold/unfold sidepane while increasing/decreasing note form width
  -style sidebar buttons
    -sprites same as evernote
  -change tag buttons to be highlighted on click, and replace remove button with delete keypress event while button is highlighted and active
  -image/file input on right sidebar of note w/ sprite

Final Round:

Refactoring
  -change jquery events into custom model events.
  -dry it out

  extra little features:
    -partial for note show item separate from note index item
    -fix bugs with random errors popping up due to bad stack order at startup
    -refactor h2 on sidepane to only rerender that part on edit
    -multiple image uploads
    -pdf uploads

  small bugs:
    -side pane note view is occasionally re-sorted after tag addition. this should not happen
