1) convert note form into composite view

-note form view has form as root el it is the main composite view
	-notebook dropdown is a part of this form

	-subviews:
		-list items for individual tags
			-selector: 'allTags'
			-View name: TagButton
			-tagName: 'li'
			-functionality
				-outside
					-they can be rendered individually and appended to the ul
					-views added to allTags after collection addition
				-inside
					-they can remove themselves after destroy click events
					-they can also change color after being clicked and talk to each other

		-tag input --> [+] button and text field
			-selector: 'add_tags'
			-View name: addTag
			-functionality
				-respond to blur events with functions moved from composite view into this view
				-toggleTags
		-title input
			-View name: TitleInput
			-Selector: note_input
			-mixin: blurrable
		-body input
			-view name: BodyInput
			-selector: 'note_input'
			-mixin: blurrable
