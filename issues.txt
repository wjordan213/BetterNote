Current Issue:



issues:
  -layout is unrendered under dev tools which looks weird

  -looks like the javascripts are being loaded on sign up and sign in page. this needs to be fixed


1)errors for note form:
  <% if (!(typeof errors === undefined)) { %>
    <ul>
      <% errors.forEach(function(error) { %>
        <li><%= error %></li>
      <% }) %>
    </ul>
  <% } %>
was throwing error.
