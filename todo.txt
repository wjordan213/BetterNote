TODO:

-move general new note to sidebar
-persist click event upon new note submission
-clear out tmp and log

now search works the way it should be working even after editing.
  -now all we have to do is properly apply removeAndInsert() and we should be good to go.



  -fix regexp error


currently:


  collectionView.add(subview.model, {sort: true})

  -remove containsModel


  -things that have bearing in this instance
  -searchContent
  -compareContent
  -addContentView
  -insertContent




  -possible currentPane issue

  -then set event listener on change to of content model to remove and then prepend the view

  -then remove tags that have no taggings

2) complete search implementation
search implementation:
  -"search whatever" displayed on search bar when empty and un-selected
  -title is selected at new form open

extra:
  -partial for note show item separate from note index item





To start:
  -remove tags after all their taggings are gone
    -Get Constance's help on this

  -drag and drop

Future:
  -either keep tag buttons in chronological order or alphabetical, whatever is easier to implement.
    -change tag buttons to be highlighted on click, and replace remove button with delete keypress event while button is highlighted and active


-remove new note from tag show side pane

-pingify heroku site

-get code review

-sniff out memory leaks and zombie views

-fix bugs with random errors popping up due to bad stack order at startup
-get it so that new can switch to edit on a note seamlessly, thus eliminating the need for the form header
  -means setting off click event after navigating to edit page

-notebook edit/show combination
  -use drop down as a convenient way to show notebook

- notes api:
  -refactor h2 on sidepane to only rerender that part on

- error messages on top of primary view for when things go wrong. get teacher's help
  -error message for invalid form input
  -error message for after redirect when trying to go to note submission without already having a notebook

CSS:
  -style sidebar buttons
  -pick appropriate colors


Concerns:
  -this._tags = new BetterNote.Collections.Tags([], { note: this });
    -why exactly? are the arguments included like this?
  -success callback not being called upon successful model destruction.
